Binary-Converter-Calculator
===========================

Converts decimal numbers to binary and vice versa. Also performs binary addition and binary multiplication.

NOTE: 
Converting from binary to decimal only works from 0 to 9.
Adding: Doesn't account for an overflow.
Multiplying: Doesn't work :(
